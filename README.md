## My Defi Learning Repo

I have read a lot about Bitcoin and Defi.  Now I am starting to explore some demonstrations.  The first one is adapted from [Dante Sblendorio's Active State Code](https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-build-a-blockchain-in-python/).  Now I know how proof-of-work and mining works.

## Reading List
- [Satoshi Nakamoto - original bitcoin paper.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)  This is worth reading but it was very technical and left me with lots of questions that were easier to understand elsewhere.  I got more out of this after learning how bitcoin works from Dante Sblendorio, thank you.
- [Dante Sblendorio's Active State Code.](https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-build-a-blockchain-in-python/) I copied this code nearly verbatim in my `blockchain.py` file.  For me, the best way to learn something is to code it.  It forces me to pay attention to the details. Dante's explanations are clear.  You don't need to use the flask web server.  I added some more blocks in my code.
